 * here without a session means the cookie was there and the refresh behind it
 * failed. Send them back through pistis rather than rendering a shell around an
 * empty page.
 *
 * The organizations are read here rather than fetched by the shell: they come
 * off the access token, which only the server can see, and passing them down
 * saves a request on every navigation.
