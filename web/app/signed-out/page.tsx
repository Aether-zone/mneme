 * Where signing out lands, and where a failed authorization comes back to.
 *
 * The layout and copy are daimon's; the brand and the button are mneme's. The
 * button is passed in rather than imported by the library so daimon does not
 * depend on kosmos — and it submits a GET form rather than sitting inside a
 * link, because kosmos's `Button` renders a real `<button>` with no `asChild`
 * escape hatch. That still works before any JavaScript has loaded, which
 * matters on the one page someone reaches when their session has just failed.
